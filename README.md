### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* FastAPI
* Uvicorn (for running the server)
* GeoJSON library (e.g., `geojson`)
* Other dependencies as needed (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git)
Navigate to the project directory:


cd spatial_api
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python3 -m venv .venv  # Or python -m venv .venv on Windows
Activate the virtual environment:

source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate on Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate on Windows
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file. If you don't have a requirements.txt file yet, create one and list the required packages (e.g., fastapi, uvicorn, geojson, etc.), one per line. See the "Adding Dependencies" section below for more information.

### Running the API

uvicorn main:app --reload  # Replace 'main' with your main file name if different
This will start the FastAPI server. The --reload flag will automatically restart the server when you make code changes. You should see output in your terminal indicating that the server has started, along with the URL where it's running (usually http://127.0.0.1:8000).
